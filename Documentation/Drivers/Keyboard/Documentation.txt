This driver is much different than the screen one, because first of all this driver uses 

a bunch of functions of the screen driver, thus its hard to analyze the output of the

functions of this driver. Secondly this function output depends on the user input.

List of all functions and their outputs:

1. _getKeyboardKey
	Input:
		- nothing
	Output:
		As I said it depends on user input so:
		
		If [SHIFT] is pressed or released:
			
			- rax is 1 if pressed and 0 if released

			- dx equals to keyboard data port

		If [Backspace] is pressed:
			
			If the cursor is on the first character of the screen:

                        	- rax is modified

                       		- rbx is modified

                        	- rcx equals to 0

                        	- rdx is a number of screen data port

                        	- rdi equals to maximum cols * 2

                	Else if the cursor is on one of the rest of the characters:

                        	- rax is modified

                        	- rbx is modified

                        	- rdx is a number of screen data port

		Else:
			
			- rax is modified
			
			- rbx equals to offset to the
        	place after the last character
                			of the string on the screen

							- rcx is modified

							- dx equals to screen data register port number

	               		 	- rsi point to the end of the string

        	       	 		- rdi equals to 0

							- r8 is modified

							- r9 equals to rsi
