	The interrupts are located in the src/interrupts folder. This folder contains

only two folders. 

	Let's start with the first one, This folder contains all of 

the Interrupt Service Routines. The _loadIDT function, which is located in AsmFun, 

loads them to 0x0 and tells the processor that it can access them in order to get 

interrupts running. So that's basically it! Oh... One other thing I forgot to mention: 

they are not idt gates. _loadIDT function defines the gates and puts the information about 

Interrupt Service Routines position into them. These routines are called when 

the interrupt is invoked (maybe it's the key press on the keyboard or one tick of the 

system clock or, heaven forbid, the division by 0). 

	The second folder contains the interrupt gate patterns. Basically, these are just

statically allocated memory that will be used to create entries in order to store them 

in the Interrupt Descriptor Table.
