_________________AsmFunOs__Interrupts__Documentation__________________

The interrupts lie in the src/interrupts folder. So this folder contains

only two folders and let's start with the second one, it's much easier to

comprehend (or not maybe). Well this folder contains all of the entries of

Interrupt Descriptor Table. The _loadIDT well... loads them into the 0x0

memory point and tells the processor that it can access them in order to 

get interrupts running. So that's basically it! Oh... One other thing I

forgot to mention: they are not the complete version of the idt gates. 

_loadIDT function also defines them and it puts the information about 

interrupt service routines memory position into them. These routines

are called if the interrupt is invoked (maybe it's the key press on the

keyboard or one tick of the system clock or heaven forbid the division by 0).

And one other thing is that these routines are stored in the second folder,

which is called interruptServiceRoutines.
