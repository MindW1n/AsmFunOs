Well, the kernel is NOT straightforward at all and that is not my fault

and I did not make it so complicated or something. Definately not! That

is so complicated because of _loadIDT function. If you look at it (it lies

in AsmFun project) firstly it's very hard to understand what is really 

happening there and secondly too. So this function loads the idt (Inter-

rupt descriptor table) just to get keyboard and clock and the other de-

vices working correctly. It was horrible to program so let's forget it

cause its done. It works and this is all that we want from it isn't it?

Kernel also loads some device drivers and AsmFunctions and then its just 

jumps to the console.
