To use any of these functions you need to use ata namespace like this: call ATA._write

Dependency of this driver is only this file:
	%include "<Your_path_to_Oasis>/src/drivers/ata.asm"

Here's a list of all functions that can be used by system to communicate with the ata:

_identify:
	Purpose:
		Initializes the communication between the cpu and the ata adapter

	Input:
		- rsi as the ata port base
		- al as the master or slave (1 if master, else 0)
	
	Output:
		- al is 1 if everything worked fine otherwise it will be 0
		- bl is equal to 0xa0 or 0xb0
		- rdx and rcx are modified

_checkPort:
	Purpose:
		Checks if the ATA port exists and print to the screen if it does

	Input:
		- rsi as a port base
		- al as master/slave bit
	
	Output:
		- every single register up to r12 is modified

_init:
	Purpose:
		Looks for ATA devices and prints to the screen if they exist

	Input:
		- nothing
	
	Output:
		- every single register up to r12 is modified
	
_read:
	Purpose:
		Reads the sector of a disk being pointed by lba

	Input:
		- rsi as a port base
		- ebx as the 28 bit lba address
		- rdi as a pointer to memory
		- rcx as the number of bytes to read
		- al as the master/slave bit

	Output:
		- al is 1 if everything worked fine, else 0
		- ebx, rdi, rcx and r8 are modified

_write:
	Purpose:
		Writes 512 bytes from memory being pointed by rsi to sector pointed by lba
	
	Input:
		- rdi as a port base
		- ebx as the 28 bit lba address
		- rsi as a pointer to memory
		- al as the master/slave bit
	
	Output:
