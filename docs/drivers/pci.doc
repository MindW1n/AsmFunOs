To use any of these functions you need to use pci namespace like this: call PCI._init

Dependency of this driver is only this file:
	%include "<Your_path_to_Oasis>/src/drivers/pci.asm"

Here's a list of all functions that can be used by system to communicate with the pci:

_readFromFunction:
	Purpose:
		Reads the device function data from PCI controller
	
	Input:
		- ax as the bus number
		- bx as the device number
		- cx as the function number
		- edx as the register offset (needs to be a multiple of 4)

	Output:
		- eax stores the device function data
		- bx, cx and edx are modified 

_writeToFunction:
	Purpose:
		Writes to the PCI function

	Input:
		- ax as the bus number
		- bx as the device number
		- cx as the function number
		- edx as the register offset
		- esi as the value we want to write

	Output:
		- eax, bx, cx, edx are modified		 

_deviceHasFunctions:
	Purpose:
       Checks if the device being connected to the PCI has any function
    
	Input:
		- ax as the bus number
		- bx as the device number

	Output:
		- bit 7 of eax is set if the device has any function
		- bx, cx and edx are modified                

_getId:
	Purpose:
    	Converts the bus, device, function and register offset into single number that it stores in eax

	Input:
		- ax as the bus number
		- bx as the device number
		- cx as the function number
		- edx as the register offset

	Output:
		- eax stores the function id
		- bx, cx, edx is modified
   
_init:
	Purpose:
    	Enumerates the devices connected to the PCI and prints their data to the screen
    
	Input:
		- nothing

	Output:
		- All registers up to r14 are used
