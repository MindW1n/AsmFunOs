_________________Oasis__Interrupt_Service_Routines__Documentation__________________

	The interrupt service routines are located in the src/isr folder. The _loadIDT function,
which is located in Asmfun, loads them to 0x0 and tells the processor that it can access them
in order to get interrupts running. _loadIDT function defines the gates and puts the information
about Interrupt Service Routines position into them. These routines are called when the interrupt
is invoked (maybe it's the key press on the keyboard or one tick of the system clock or, heaven
forbid, the division by 0).
