ToDo list for the AsmFun operating system:

1. Write a bootloader that reads the kernel from a disk and jumps to 64-bit protected mode. Done!
2. Write drivers for diskdrive, screen, keyboard, flashdrives. 1/2done...
3. Write a filesystem (firstly, that will be fat).
4. Write a console.

...

999. Write my own filesystem. Before that moment I use a fat12 filesystem.
