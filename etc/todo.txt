ToDo list for the AsmFun operating system:

1. Write a bootloader that reads the kernel from a disk and jumps to 64-bit protected mode. 
2. Write drivers for diskdrive, screen, keyboard, flashdrives. 1/2done...
3. Enable paging and usermode.
4. Write POSIX-like syscalls.
5. Write process scheduler 
6. Write a filesystem (firstly, that will be fat). 
7. Write a console (something like bash).

...

999. Write my own filesystem. Before that moment I use a fat12 filesystem.
