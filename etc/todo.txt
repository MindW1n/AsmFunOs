ToDo list for the AsmFun operating system:

1. Write a bootloader that reads the kernel from a disk and jumps to 32-bit protected mode and 64-bit long mode sequentially.
2. Write drivers for diskdrive, screen, keyboard, flashdrives.
3. Write a filesystem (firstly, that will be fat).
4. Write a console.

...

999. Write my own filesystem. Before that moment I use a fat12 filesystem.
